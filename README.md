# This project is built on flutter version 3.0

A sample app demonstrating implementation of different types of services provided by firebase.
-> FirebaseAuth
-> FireStore 
-> Firebase Remote Config 

## Implemented Riverpod (A better provider) state management technique and tried to follow domain driven architecture. Keeping the UI layer || provider layer || repository layer separate.

**Dio is used as networking library.**

Few enhancements which can be done in future :- 
1. Checking if the user is logged in or not.
2. Logging out of the user.
3. Making obscure password field.
4. Adding clear text in textField as a suffix icon.
